Open Ear Trainer is a software to train your ear to distinguish frequencies.

# Setup

You can use (brown) noise or import an MP3. Then, there are two canals: one whose effect's parameters depend on the three sliders, and one whose parameters are random. The settings of this latter canal are revealed with the *answer* button. Each effect can be removed; however, the answer button will always show all of the parameters.

# The effects

The first effect is a **bandpass**. It cuts all frequencies but some around a given one. It is this parameter that you need to find. Note that the slider is not linear, as is the perception of frequency.
The second effect is a **panner**. The track is played in mono, and a panner shifts the position of the sound. This is the second parameter.
The third effect is Â a **gain**. The last parameter is given by how much dB the track gains (or loses).

# How to use

Here are three different games, but please contact us if you find other ways to play!

## Free exploration

Stay in the first canal and tweak the parameters. Hear how the track reacts!

## Match

Switch between the tracks (key T) to match the parameters from the first track to those of the second track. Check your answer with the *answer* button, and use the *randomize* button to play again.

## Direct Guess
Stay in the second canal and find directly the values of the parameters (you can use keys 1, 2, and 3 to turn on and off the parameters). Check your answer with the *answer* button, switch between the tracks if you want to hear your proposition, and use the *randomize* button to play again.
